# T-Rex

A 5x12 Ortholinear qmk compatible Keyboard. The keyboard is designed to be easily ordered by anyone from a PCB manufacturer and assembled by yourself. The Firmware is currently only on my fork of [qmk](https://github.com/SylivanKenobi/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/t_rex). The keyboard is compatible with Pro Micro controllers and their derivatives. Additionally, it supports WS2812 LED strips as an extra feature. For the case I use 18mm high M2 standoffs.

Example parts:
* [Controller](https://splitkb.com/products/pro-micro-atmega32u4-5v-16mhz)
* [Diodes](https://splitkb.com/products/tht-diodes)
